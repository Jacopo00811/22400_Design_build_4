# 22400_Design_Build_4_Mussel_control_device
Code for the course 22400 Design-build 4: Autonomous devices for controlling and studying living systems (Jun 23) at DTU.

The device had a PID controller connected to a cooler to  keep the water temperature to 17 dregrees. Also another pump was used to bring algae to the mussels and clean their water from waste secretions.
